    //MARK: PROPERTIES
    //this property is used to store the (success, error) results from Client.createUdacitySesssionFromFacebook; these results are used later to pass into the completeLogin method, once it is determined that login has been successful and that the segue ot the tab bar view controller (with map and table) is safe to proceed
    var facebookLoginResults: (Bool, String?)?
    
    //the three properties below were implemented to monitor "readiness to segue" after having logged in with facebook (which was presenting some timing challenges due to some inconsistency with when the facebook login manager was dismissing the safari view controller after a successful login); when all three are true, the LoginSuccessfulSegue segue is deemed ready to take place; each variable is set at a different time, and each time one is set to either true or false, the "determineIfSegueCanHappen" gets called as part of the didSet property observer, which checks to see if all three are true; if all three are true (as well as if other conditions are met, as described in more detail in the method below), the "completeLogin" occurs, which checks to see if "success" is true (either from the facebook login or the traditional username/password login) and if so, allows the segue to take place; the reason it was necessary to monitor certain aspects of the login process before segueing came about specifically as a result of a timing issue with the facebook login process - when the user taps the login with facebook button and the facebook manager opens up a safari window, the modal view presented by the facebook SDK SOMETIMES returned back to the login screen before the completion handler was finished (and token active), and other times AFTER, which caused issues with automatically enabling the segue to occur when login was true; thus, the three properties monitor whether the login view controller is active (i.e. the facebook SDK has dismissed the safari window), that the facebook loading completed (i.e. the logInWithReadPermissions method returned, regardless of whether it was successful or not), and that the login to udactity using the facebook token completed (again, regardless of result)
    
    //this property is set true when the view appears (of particular importance is when the view reappears after having returned from facebook login window), and false when it disappears (of importance is when the facebook login button is tapped and the facebook login screen appears)
    var loginViewActive = false {
        didSet { determineIfSegueCanHappen() }
    }
    
    //this property is set to true when the completion handler of the Client.facebookManager.logInWithReadPermissions method is called (regardless of if it was successful or not)
    var facebookLoadedComplete = false {
        didSet { determineIfSegueCanHappen() }
    }
    
    //this proerty is set to true when the completion handler of the Client.createUdacitySesssionFromFacebook method is called (also regardless of if it was successful or not)
    var facebookLoginToUdacityComplete = false {
        didSet { determineIfSegueCanHappen() }

    //MARK: CUSTOM METHODS

    func loginToUdacity() {
        if checkForCompleteTextFields() {

            passwordTextField.resignFirstResponder()
            usernameTextField.resignFirstResponder()
        }
    }
    
    ///method that performs the login with facebook routine and is connected to the "Login with Facebook" button (see viewDidLoad for setup of this button); when tapped, all buttons/fields are disabled (thus graying them out, by sending "true" to the custom disableViewsDuringLogin method), a spinner is started, and a check is made to see if a current facebook token exists on the device; if the current facebook token is nil (e.g. this is the first time logging in with facebook, or the user tapped the "logout" button in the previous session after having logged in with facebook), then a new facebook session is created through using the facebook manager's login method, which takes the user to a safari screen on which they must login and/or authenticate the app to use facebook; if there was no error and the user didn't cancel out of the screen, the token's "tokenString" representation is extracted from the result and passed to the Client.createUdacitySesssionFromFacebook method to complete the login (if successful, the results are saved for later use in the determineIfSegueCanHappen method); if a facebook token already currently exists on the system (i.e. one was saved from a previous login from facebook in which the user quit the app without logging out), then the token's "tokenString" representation is extracted from the result and passed to the Client.createUdacitySesssionFromFacebook method to complete the login, without having to authenticate through facebook again (i.e. the user is not taken to a safari screen); notably, it is in this method that TWO of the three "ready for segue" variables are set during the process by which a new token is created, since it the timing around going to a safari screen and coming back after a token is successfully created; at line 93, these two variables are now true, and the third is set to true when the login view controller again becomes active through within the viewDidAppear method (i.e. the safari screen has completely gone away), at which point, when the determineIfSegueCanHappen as part of the didSet property observer, the first line of that method is true and the segue can then continue on (this prevented the segue from getting called before the safari view had completely been dismissed by the facebook SDK, or before the token had been completely retrieved and udactity session created from it)
